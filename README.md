# IRL ROS lyrical buildfarm (Pixi + Vinca + Rattler)

This repository is a fork of the upstream RoboStack ROS lyrical packaging repo:

- https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-lyrical

In this fork, we use the same toolchain (Pixi + Vinca + rattler-build) to build and publish **additional ROS 2 lyrical packages** produced by the **Intelligent Robotics Lab (IRL)**:

- https://intelligentroboticslab.gsyc.urjc.es/

The resulting binaries are published to prefix.dev (the `irl-lyrical` channel) and can also be consumed locally via a file-based channel.
